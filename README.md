# Instagram Caption Keyword Search

**Find Instagram posts by what people actually wrote.** Give this Actor a keyword like `stanley` or a phrase like `very happy`, and it returns Instagram posts whose **caption contains that keyword** — together with the author, like and comment counts, the post URL, the image, and the date. Try it by typing a keyword in the Input tab and clicking **Start**.

This Actor runs on the [Apify platform](https://apify.com), so you get API access, scheduling, integrations (Make, Zapier, Google Sheets), proxy rotation, and run monitoring out of the box.

## Why use Instagram Caption Keyword Search?

- **Social listening** — track every public post mentioning your brand, product, or campaign phrase.
- **Influencer & UGC discovery** — find creators already talking about a topic in their own words.
- **Trend research** — see how a keyword or slogan is being used across captions.
- **Lead and content sourcing** — collect captions, authors, and engagement metrics into a structured dataset you can export.

## How to use Instagram Caption Keyword Search

1. Open the **Input** tab.
2. Type your **Keyword** (for example `stanley` or `very happy`).
3. Optionally set **Max matching posts** (default `50`).
4. Click **Start** and wait for the run to finish.
5. Open the **Output**/Storage tab and download the results as JSON, CSV, Excel, or HTML.

## How it works

Instagram has no public full-text caption search, so this Actor composes Apify's well-maintained [`apify/instagram-scraper`](https://apify.com/apify/instagram-scraper):

1. Your keyword is turned into a hashtag seed (`very happy` → `#veryhappy`) to gather a pool of likely-relevant posts.
2. `apify/instagram-scraper` scrapes those candidate posts.
3. The Actor keeps only the posts whose **caption actually contains your keyword** (case-insensitive substring match) and saves them to the dataset.

Because it calls the underlying scraper, that run consumes its own Apify usage in addition to this Actor's compute.

## Input

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `keyword` | string (required) | The word or phrase to look for in captions, e.g. `stanley` or `very happy`. |
| `maxPosts` | integer | Maximum number of matching posts to return (default `50`, max `1000`). |

Example input:

```json
{
    "keyword": "very happy",
    "maxPosts": 50
}
```

## Output

Each item in the dataset is one matching post. You can download the dataset in various formats such as JSON, HTML, CSV, or Excel.

```json
{
    "keyword": "very happy",
    "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cxxxxxxxxxx/",
    "caption": "We are very happy to share our new collection! #veryhappy",
    "ownerUsername": "examplebrand",
    "ownerFullName": "Example Brand",
    "likesCount": 1234,
    "commentsCount": 56,
    "timestamp": "2026-05-30T12:00:00.000Z",
    "type": "Image",
    "displayUrl": "https://instagram.com/.../image.jpg",
    "hashtags": ["veryhappy"],
    "mentions": [],
    "shortCode": "Cxxxxxxxxxx",
    "id": "1234567890"
}
```

### Data fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `keyword` | The keyword that was searched. |
| `url` | Direct link to the Instagram post. |
| `caption` | Full caption text (contains your keyword). |
| `ownerUsername` / `ownerFullName` | The post author. |
| `likesCount` / `commentsCount` | Engagement metrics. |
| `timestamp` | When the post was published. |
| `type` | Post type (Image, Video, Sidecar). |
| `displayUrl` | URL of the post's main image. |
| `hashtags` / `mentions` | Hashtags and @mentions found in the post. |
| `shortCode` / `id` | Instagram identifiers for the post. |

## Cost estimation

Most of the cost comes from the underlying `apify/instagram-scraper` run, which is billed per result. A higher `maxPosts` scrapes more candidate posts (the Actor fetches roughly 3× your `maxPosts` to allow for caption filtering). Start with a small `maxPosts` to gauge cost, then scale up. See the [Apify pricing page](https://apify.com/pricing) and the `apify/instagram-scraper` pricing for current rates.

## Tips & advanced options

- **Short, common keywords** (like `stanley`) return more matches than rare phrases.
- The keyword's letters and digits become the hashtag seed, so `very happy` searches the `#veryhappy` hashtag but still filters captions by the exact phrase `very happy`.
- Lower `maxPosts` for faster, cheaper runs; raise it for broader coverage.
- Schedule the Actor (Schedules tab) to monitor a keyword over time.

## FAQ, disclaimers, and support

- **Is this legal?** The Actor only collects publicly available data. You are responsible for complying with Instagram's Terms of Service and applicable laws (including data-protection rules) when using the output.
- **Why did I get no results?** The hashtag may have too few public posts, or no caption contained the exact keyword. Try a more common keyword.
- **Why are some posts missing?** Only posts surfaced through the hashtag seed are scanned. Private posts are never accessed.
- **Support / feedback:** Use the **Issues** tab on the Actor page. Custom variations (search by user, place, or comments) can be added on request.
